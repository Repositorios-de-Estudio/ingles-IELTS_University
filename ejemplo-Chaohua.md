In China, it is important for us to learn English because if you do well in English, you can get a good job far more than non-speaking English.

Secondly, many linguists consider that young children are studying language better than adults. If a young child live in many different countries in childhood, he or she may speak 3 or 4 languages. Therefore, more and more young children start to learn English in kindergartens.

### 1st paragraph

1. Is there a paragraph leader for this paragraph?
   * Yes - ‘The majority of official languages are English’. However, this is different from the plan, which refers to English as the main international language. This is more accurate than describing it as an ‘official language’ in most countries.

   * Yes - some. Chaohua gives the example that children can learn 3 or 4 languages but she does not prove that children learn languages more quickly than adults.

Chaohua has given some evidence that adults care for their children - because they want them to be successful. However, she needs to add more examples or facts about this.

###  Conclusion

1. Does the conclusion sum up the body paragraphs?
   *  Chaohua sums up with the idea that learning English is popular with children because English is spoken widely and children learn quickly.(Paragraphs 1 and 2). She has not summed up paragraph 3.
2.  Does it end with a prediction or some advice for the future?
     * It ends with a prediction.

### Sugestion

Chaohua needs to improve her summing up.

On the whole, Chaohua has organised her essay well into sections which make her ideas fairly easy to understand. However, she needs to write more words! Her essay is too short at 231 words. She needs to develop her ideas, and include more facts and examples as evidence in order to persuade her readers that her beliefs are correct.
