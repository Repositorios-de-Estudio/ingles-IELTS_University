**Discuss the reasons why is important Colombian dishes for internal migrants in Bogotá**

Bogotá is the capital of Colombia, it has 51.6 million habitants, which is 15% of the whole population. Colombia has a great variety of food, mainly represented by fruits and vegetables by geographic advantages, their wheater is temperate, warm, tropical and high mountains. People can find a great variety of fruits and vegetables. Colombia exported $1.3000 million of fruits and vegetals in the first semester of 2023 only to the USA. Also, this great variety is exploited by internal migrants and most local gastronomy is made dishes, so reader can why are important Colombian dishes for internal migrants in this essay.

Internal migrants identify with their own culture and food. Each region has their own culture and food, because each region has their own customs and their own way of preparing dishes, some food is in whole of Country with different preparation, so dishes are different. This preparation allows to identify a person from another region, and this is a good way to feel at home, so when internal migrants are in Bogotá, people can know where is internal migrant from. Preparation depends of their region, so people can find similar food in different regions in Bogotá, Sancocho Valluno from Valle del cauca,  Sancocho trifásico throughout Colombia or Sancocho de pescado from the coast. These dishes are most same ingredients: rice, corn, potato, cassava, beans, plantain and avocado, and most same meats: meats such as beef, chicken, pork and fish, and most same fruits: mango, banana, papaya, guava, lulo and passion fruit, and panela. Most internal migrants take advantage these dishes to earn money.

Also, internal migrants use their gastronomy to sell dishes in Bogotá. When an internal migrant arrives to Bogotá have to seek how to earn money, most internal migrants arrive to Bogotá without cash and support, so they prefer to start their own business such as a restaurant that offer their own dishes. Generally, these kind of restaurants prosper by their dishes and they expand in Bogotá, so this way people can find Hormigas Culonas from the Region of Santander, lechona and tamales from Tolima and Cazuela de mariscos from Coast. Another option is start a bakery or pastry, their bread and candys are desired by people of Bogotá because they like candy, some are Pan de bono from Valle del Cauca, Crema de café from Eje Cafetero, Mazamorra con bocadillo, Natilla, Arroz con leche, leche asada from Antioquia, and Bocadillo veleño, Sabajón, masato from Region of Santander. Some of these are part of culture and customs of Colombian people, natilla and arroz con leche are used by most regions of Colombia at Christmas, panela and bocadillo veleño are used to restore energy. People can find a great variety of dishes from other regions in Bogotá as well as other food such as desserts, sweets, ice creams, juices, alcoholic beverages and more.

Internal migrants want to keep their identity, and some of them prefer to feel like at home by cooking their gastronomy for themselves, others prefer to start a business and earn money. Most people prefer to eat their own dishes and customs, maybe it will be like this forever.
